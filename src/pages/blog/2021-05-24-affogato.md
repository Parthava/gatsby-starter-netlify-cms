Though restaurants and cafes in Italy categorize the affogato as a dessert, some restaurants and cafes outside of Italy categorize it as a beverage.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-huff2-7) Whether a dessert or beverage, restaurants and cafes usually serve the affogato in a tall narrowing glass, allowing the fior di latte, vanilla gelato, or ice cream melt and combine with espresso into the hollowed space in the bottom of the glass.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-8) Occasionally, coconut, berries, honeycomb and multiple flavors of ice cream are added.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-9) A biscotti or cookie can also be served and enjoyed alongside this beverage.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-10) Affogatos are often enjoyed as a post-meal coffee dessert combo eaten and or drunk with a spoon or straw. [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-11)

While the recipe of the affogato is more or less standard in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), consisting of a scoop of [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla "Vanilla") [gelato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato "Gelato") topped with a shot of [espresso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso "Espresso"), variations exist in European and American restaurants.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-13)

In French, it is known as "gelato al fior di latte" with the translation to English "flower of milk".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato#cite_note-14) Typically the ingredients in the ice cream includes dairy, starch, and sugar. It is popular in countries where they dress it with chocolate syrup, cantuccini, or biscotti to provide extra flavors.
